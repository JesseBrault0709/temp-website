                    Conductor and composer <strong>Jesse Brault</strong> studied
                    orchestral conducting at the Juilliard School with Maestros
                    Alan Gilbert and James Ross. After making his New York debut
                    at Alice Tully Hall in 2015, he conducted semesterly
                    concerts with the Juilliard Conductors’ Lab Orchestra.
                    During his studies, he worked with such distinguished
                    conductors as Bernard Haitink, Gianandrea Noseda, Fabio
                    Luisi, David Zinman, and James Gaffigan.
                </p>

                <p>
                    In 2019, Brault made his Carnegie Hall debut conducting a
                    performance of John Adams’ <i>Chamber Symphony</i> with
                    Ensemble Connect. He has also led the Orlando Philharmonic,
                    accompanying their music director Eric Jacobsen in a
                    performance of Dvorak’s <i>Silent Woods</i>. He has assisted
                    at orchestras in the United States and Europe, including
                    Boston Symphony, St. Louis Symphony, New Jersey Symphony,
                    and the NDR Elbphilharmonie Orchestra.

                    Brault’s compositions have been performed and recorded
                    across the United States and Europe. Specializing in works
                    for solo instruments and chamber ensembles, recent works
                    include three projects sponsored by Musaics of the Bay of
                    San Francisco: <i>Capriccioso</i>, a work inspired by Carel
                    Fabritius’ painting <i>The Goldfinch</i> and recorded by
                    recorderist Lucie Horsch, violinist Tosca Opdam, and harpist
                    Anneleen Schuitemaker at the Mauritshuis in The Hague;
                    <i>Near, Under, Far</i>, recorded in New York by cellist
                    Gabriel Cabezas; and <i>Arcadia</i>, recorded in Berlin by
                    violinist Stephen Waarts and pianist Julia Hamos. In 2018,
                    Brault composed <i>Sonata Shambhala</i>, a large-scale piano
                    work based on the secular Buddhist teachings of Chogyam
                    Trungpa and premiered by pianist Benjamin Hochman. Brault
                    has also collaborated with Concerts for Compassion, a violin
                    duo based in New York who premiered his
                    <i>Conversations</i> in 2019. Brault’s music has been heard
                    on various radio stations in New York, San Francisco, and
                    the Netherlands.

                    While his main passion is immersing himself in the standard
                    repertoire, Brault also has an affinity for conducting
                    contemporary music. He appeared at National Sawdust in 2018
                    leading newly composed opera scenes by Joshua Getman and Sam
                    Wu, and also at Juilliard’s <i>Focus!</i> 2016 and 2018
                    festivals, conducting music of Milton Babbitt and Liu Yuhui.
                    In 2018, he conducted Sofia Gubaidulina’s
                    <i>Bassoon Concerto</i> with solo bassoonist Frank Morelli.
                    In 2019, Brault co-founded Red Dog Ensemble, a New York
                    based chamber group with which he recorded a
                    soon-to-be-released album of all new works by emerging
                    composers.

                    Growing up in rural Wisconsin, Brault began his studies as a
                    trombonist and pianist. As a young composer, he garnered
                    performances of his music in such places as the Aspen Music
                    Festival and Boston’s Faneuil Hall. He later attended St.
                    Olaf College in Minnesota where he studied music theory and
                    composition, graduating <i>summa cum laude</i>. While there,
                    he began his conducting career, organizing a performance of
                    Mozart’s <i>Jupiter</i> Symphony, and later leading the St.
                    Olaf Orchestra in touring performances of Debussy’s “Fêtes”
                    from <i>Trois Nocturnes</i>. As both conductor and composer,
                    he led performances of his piano concerto
                    <i>Illuminatio</i> with the St. Olaf Band throughout the
                    United States. His teachers at St. Olaf included Steven
                    Amundson, Timothy Mahr, and Justin Merritt.

                    Also enjoying sharing music with younger students, Brault
                    was the conductor of the first Nord Anglia Performing Arts
                    Festival for Europe and the Middle East in Bratislava,
                    Slovakia, in 2019. There he led orchestras of young
                    musicians aged ten to eighteen from two continents, bringing
                    together students of many backgrounds toward a common
                    musical cause.

                <p>
                    Outside of music, Brault enjoys a number of pursuits,
                    including computer programming, linguistics, running, and
                    cooking. He currently resides in Berlin, Germany.
